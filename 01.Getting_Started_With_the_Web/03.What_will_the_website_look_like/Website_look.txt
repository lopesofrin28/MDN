What will your website look like? discusses the planning and design work you have to do for your website before writing code,
including "What information does my website offer?",
"What fonts and colors do I want?", and "What does my site do?"


-First things first: Planning:-

1] What is your website about?
2] What information are you presenting on the subject?
3] What does your website look like?

-Sketching out your design:-

Next, grab pen and paper and sketch out roughly how you want your site to look.
For your first simple webpage, there's not much to sketch out, but you should get in the habit of doing this now.


-Choosing your assets:-

At this point, it's good to start putting together the content that will eventually appear on your webpage.
1] Text
2] Theme Color
