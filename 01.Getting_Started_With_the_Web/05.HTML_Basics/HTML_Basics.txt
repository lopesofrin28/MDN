So what is HTML?
-HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language that defines the structure of your content.
HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content
to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink
 to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.


1] The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p),
wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins
or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.

2] The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash
 before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends.
 Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.

3] The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.

4] The element: The opening tag, the closing tag and the content together comprise the element.

5] The Attributes: Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear
in the actual content. Here, class is the attribute name and editor-note is the attribute value.
The class attribute allows you to give the element an identifier that can be used later to target the
element with style information and other things.
