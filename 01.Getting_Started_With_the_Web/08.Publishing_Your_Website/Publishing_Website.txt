1]  Getting hosting and a domain name
-Web hosting is rented file space on a hosting company's web server.
  You put website files on the web server. The web server provides website content to website visitors.

-A domain name is the unique address where people find your website,
such as http://www.mozilla.org or http://www.bbc.co.uk. You can rent your domain name for as many years as you want
from a domain registrar.

2]  Using an online tool like GitHub or Google App Engine

3]  Using a web-based IDE such as CodePen
    -JSFiddle
    -Glitch
    -JS Bin
    -CodePen


4]  Publishing via GitHub
-First of all, sign up for GitHub and verify your email address.
-Next, you need to create a repository to store files.
-On this page, in the Repository name box, enter username.github.io, where username is your username.
  For example, our friend Bob Smith would enter bobsmith.github.io.
-Check the "Initialize this repository with a README" box. Then click Create repository.
-Drag and drop the content of your website folder into your repository. Then click Commit changes.
  (Note: Make sure your folder has an index.html file.)
-Navigate your browser to username.github.io to see your website online.
For example, for the username chrisdavidmills, go to chrisdavidmills.github.io.
  (Note: It may take a few minutes for your website to go live. If your website does not display immediately,
   wait a few minutes. Try again.)
