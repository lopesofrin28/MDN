-What is CSS?
Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either.
CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements.
For example, this CSS selects paragraph text, setting the color to red:

p {
  color: red;
}


*Anatomy of a CSS ruleset:
- Selector
  This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset.
  It defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example, <p> elements).
  To style a different element, change the selector.

- Declaration:
  This is a single rule like color: red;.
  It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style.

- Properties:
  These are ways in which you can style an HTML element.
  (In this example, color is a property of the <p> elements.)
  In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.

- Property value
  To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property value.
  This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property.
  (For example, there are many color values in addition to red.)



* Different types of selectors:

- Element selector (sometimes called a tag or type selector)
  Example- p

- ID selector
 Example- #my-id

- Class selector
  Example- .my-class

- Attribute selector	(The element(s) on the page with the specified attribute.)
Example- img[src]
         selects <img src="myimage.png"> but not <img>

- Pseudo-class selector	(The specified element(s), but only when in the specified state. (For example, when a cursor hovers over a link.))
  Example- a:hover
           selects <a>, but only when the mouse pointer is hovering over the link.
