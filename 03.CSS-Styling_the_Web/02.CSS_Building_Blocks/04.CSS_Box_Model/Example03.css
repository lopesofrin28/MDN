Playing with box models:
In the below example, you can see two boxes. Both have a class of .box, which gives them the same width, height, margin, border,
 and padding. The only difference is that the second box has been set to use the alternative box model.

Can you change the size of the second box (by adding CSS to the .alternate class) to make it match the first box in width and height?
Task: Change the size of the second box (by adding CSS to the .alternate class) to make it match the first box in width and height.



.alternate {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  width: 390px;
  height: 240px;
}
