/* We can see how inline elements behave in this next example. The <span> elements in the first paragraph are inline by default and so
do not force line breaks.

We also have a <ul> element which is set to display: inline-flex, creating an inline box around some flex items.

Finally, we have two paragraphs both set to display: inline. The inline flex container and paragraphs all run together on one
line rather than breaking onto new lines as they would do if they were displaying as block-level elements.

In the example, you can change display: inline to display: block or display: inline-flex to display: flex to toggle between
these display modes. */
