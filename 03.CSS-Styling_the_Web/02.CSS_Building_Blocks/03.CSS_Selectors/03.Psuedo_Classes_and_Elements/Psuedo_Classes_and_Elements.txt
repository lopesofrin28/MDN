*What is a pseudo-class?
-A pseudo-class is a selector that selects elements that are in a specific state, e.g. they are the first element of their type,
or they are being hovered over by the mouse pointer. They tend to act as if you had applied a class to some part of your document,
often helping you cut down on excess classes in your markup, and giving you more flexible, maintainable code.

-Pseudo-classes are keywords that start with a colon:

    :pseudo-class-name


*User-action pseudo classes:
-Some pseudo-classes only apply when the user interacts with the document in some way. These user-action pseudo-classes,
sometimes referred to as dynamic pseudo-classes, act as if a class had been added to the element when the user interacts with it.
Examples include:

:hover — mentioned above; this only applies if the user moves their pointer over an element, typically a link.
:focus — only applies if the user focuses the element using keyboard controls.


*What is a pseudo-element?
-Pseudo-elements behave in a similar way, however they act as if you had added a whole new HTML element into the markup, rather
than applying a class to existing elements. Pseudo-elements start with a double colon ::.

  ::pseudo-element-name


*Combining pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements
-If you wanted to make the first line of the first paragraph bold you could chain the :first-child and ::first-line selectors together.
Try editing the previous live example so it uses the following CSS. We are saying that we want to select the first line, of the
first <p> element, which is inside an <article> element.


*Generating content with ::before and ::after
-There are a couple of special pseudo-elements, which are used along with the content property to insert content into your
document using CSS.
-These pseudo-elements are also frequently used to insert an empty string, which can then be styled just like any element on the page.
-The use of the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements along with the content property is referred to as "Generated Content" in CSS,
and you will often see this technique being used for various tasks. A great example is the site CSS Arrow Please, which helps you
to generate an arrow with CSS. Look at the CSS as you create your arrow and you will see the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements
in use. Whenever you see these selectors, look at the content property to see what is being added to the document.
