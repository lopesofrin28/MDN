What is a selector?
-You have met selectors already. A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. It is a pattern of elements and other terms that
tell the browser which HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them. The element
or elements which are selected by the selector are referred to as the subject of the selector.


*Selector lists
-If you have more than one thing which uses the same CSS then the individual selectors can be combined into a selector list so that
the rule is applied to all of the individual selectors.
I could also combine these into a selector list, by adding a comma between them.


*Types of selectors
-There are a few different groupings of selectors, and knowing which type of selector you might need will help you to find the
right tool for the job. In this article's subarticles we will look at the different groups of selectors in more detail.

*Type, class, and ID selectors
1]This group includes selectors that target an HTML element such as an <h1>.
ex: h1 { }
2]It also includes selectors which target a class:
ex: .box { }
3] or, an ID:
ex: #unique { }


*Attribute selectors
-This group of selectors gives you different ways to select elements based on the presence of a certain attribute on an element:
      a[title] { }
Or even make a selection based on the presence of an attribute with a particular value:

      a[href="https://example.com"] { }


*Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements
-This group of selectors includes pseudo-classes, which style certain states of an element. The :hover pseudo-class for example
selects an element only when it is being hovered over by the mouse pointer:
a:hover { }
-It also includes pseudo-elements, which select a certain part of an element rather than the element itself. For example,
 ::first-line always selects the first line of text inside an element (a <p> in the below case), acting as if a <span> was wrapped
around the first formatted line and then selected.
p::first-line { }

*Combinators
-The final group of selectors combine other selectors in order to target elements within our documents. The following for example
selects paragraphs that are direct children of <article> elements using the child combinator (>):
article > p { }
