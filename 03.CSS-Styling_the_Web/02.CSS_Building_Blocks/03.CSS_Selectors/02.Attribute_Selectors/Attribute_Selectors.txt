*Presence and value selectors
-These selectors enable the selection of an element based on the presence of an attribute alone (for example href), or on various
different matches against the value of the attribute.

Selector	Example	Description

-[attr]	a[title]	Matches elements with an attr attribute (whose name is the value in square brackets).

-[attr=value]	a[href="https://example.com"]	Matches elements with an attr attribute whose value is exactly value —
the string inside the quotes.

-[attr~=value]	p[class~="special"]
Matches elements with an attr attribute whose value is exactly value, or contains value in its (space separated) list of values.

-[attr|=value]	div[lang|="zh"]	Matches elements with an attr attribute whose value is exactly value or begins with value immediately
followed by a hyphen.

*Substring matching selectors
-These selectors allow for more advanced matching of substrings inside the value of your attribute. For example, if you had classes of
box-warning and box-error and wanted to match everything that started with the string "box-", you could use [class^="box-"] to select
them both (or [class|="box"] as described in section above).

-[attr^=value]	li[class^="box-"]	Matches elements with an attr attribute (whose name is the value in square brackets),
 whose value begins with value.

-[attr$=value]	li[class$="-box"]	Matches elements with an attr attribute whose value ends with value.

-[attr*=value]	li[class*="box"]	Matches elements with an attr attribute whose value contains value anywhere within the string.

-(Aside: It may help to note that ^ and $ have long been used as anchors in so-called regular expressions to mean begins with
 and ends with.)


*Case-sensitivity
-If you want to match attribute values case-insensitively you can use the value i before the closing bracket. This flag tells the
browser to match ASCII characters case-insensitively. Without the flag the values will be matched according to the case-sensitivity
of the document language — in HTML's case it will be case sensitive.
