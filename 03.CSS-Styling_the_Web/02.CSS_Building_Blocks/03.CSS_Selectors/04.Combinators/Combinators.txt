The final selectors we will look at are called combinators, because they combine other selectors in a way that gives them a useful
relationship to each other and the location of content in the document.

*Descendant combinator
-The descendant combinator — typically represented by a single space ( ) character — combines two selectors such that elements matched
by the second selector are selected if they have an ancestor (parent, parent's parent, parent's parent's parent, etc) element matching
the first selector. Selectors that utilize a descendant combinator are called descendant selectors.

*Child combinator
-The child combinator (>) is placed between two CSS selectors. It matches only those elements matched by the second selector that
are the direct children of elements matched by the first. Descendent elements further down the hierarchy don't match. For example,
to select only <p> elements that are direct children of <article> elements:

    article > p


*Adjacent sibling combinator
-The adjacent sibling selector (+) is used to select something if it is right next to another element at the same level of the
hierarchy. For example, to select all <img> elements that come right after <p> elements:

    p + img



*General sibling combinator
-If you want to select siblings of an element even if they are not directly adjacent, then you can use the general sibling
combinator (~). To select all <img> elements that come anywhere after <p> elements, we'd do this:

    p ~ img


*Using combinators
-You can combine any of the selectors that we discovered in previous lessons with combinators in order to pick out part of your
document. For example if we want to select list items with a class of "a", which are direct children of a <ul>, I could use the
following.

    ul > li[class="a"]  {  }

-Take care however when creating big lists of selectors that select very specific parts of your document. It will be hard to reuse
the CSS rules as you have made the selector very specific to the location of that element in the markup.
