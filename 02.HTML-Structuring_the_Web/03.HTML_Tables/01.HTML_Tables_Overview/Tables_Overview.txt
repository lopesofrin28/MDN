A very common task in HTML is structuring tabular data, and it has a number of elements and attributes for just this purpose.
Coupled with a little CSS for styling, HTML makes it easy to display tables of information on the web such as your school
lesson plan, the timetable at your local swimming pool, or statistics about your favorite dinosaurs or football team.
This module takes you through all you need to know about structuring tabular data using HTML.

This module contains the following articles:

[1]HTML table basics
This article gets you started with HTML tables, covering the very basics such as rows and cells, headings, making cells
span multiple columns and rows, and how to group together all the cells in a column for styling purposes.

[2]HTML table advanced features and accessibility
This module looks at some more advanced features of HTML tables — such as captions/summaries and grouping your rows
into table head, body and footer sections — as well as looking at the accessibility of tables for visually impaired users.
