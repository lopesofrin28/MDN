What is a hyperlink?
-Hyperlinks are one of the most exciting innovations the Web has to offer.
Well, they've been a feature of the Web since the very beginning,
but they are what makes the Web a Web â€” they allow us to link our documents to any other document
 (or other resource) we want to, we can also link to specific parts of documents, and we can make apps
 available at a simple web address (contrast this to native apps, which have to be installed and all that business.)

*Adding supporting information with the title attribute
Another attribute you may want to add to your links is title; this is intended to contain supplementary
useful information about the link, such as what kind of information the page contains, or things to be aware of.

*E-mail links
-It is possible to create links or buttons that, when clicked, open a new outgoing email message rather than
linking to a resource or page. This is done using the <a> element and the mailto: URL scheme.
eg: <a href="mailto:nowhere@mozilla.org">Send email to nowhere</a>

-In addition to the email address, you can provide other information.
In fact, any standard mail header fields can be added to the mailto URL you provide.
The most commonly used of these are "subject", "cc", and "body" (which is not a true header field,
but allows you to specify a short content message for the new email). Each field and its value is specified as a query term.

Here's an example that includes a cc, bcc, subject and body:
-<a href="mailto:nowhere@mozilla.org?cc=name2@rapidtables.com&bcc=name3@rapidtables.com&subject=The%20subject%20of%20the%20email&body=The%20body%20of%20the%20email">
  Send mail with cc, bcc, subject and body
</a>

Note: The values of each field must be URL-encoded, that is with non-printing characters
(invisible characters like tabs, carriage returns, and page breaks) and spaces percent-escaped.
Also note the use of the question mark (?) to separate the main URL from the field values,
and ampersands (&) to separate each field in the mailto: URL. This is standard URL query notation.
