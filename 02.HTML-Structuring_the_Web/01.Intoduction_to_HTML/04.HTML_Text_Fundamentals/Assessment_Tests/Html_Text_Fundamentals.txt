1] The basics: Headings and Paragraphs

Most structured text consists of headings and paragraphs, whether you are reading a story,
a newspaper, a college textbook, a magazine, etc.
Structured content makes the reading experience easier and more enjoyable.
-In HTML, each paragraph has to be wrapped in a <p> element.
-Each heading has to be wrapped in a heading element.

-There are six heading elements â€” <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, and <h6>.
Each element represents a different level of content in the document; <h1> represents the main heading,
<h2> represents subheadings, <h3> represents sub-subheadings, and so on.


2] Lists
1:Unordered
-Unordered lists are used to mark up lists of items for which the order of the items doesn't matter.

2:Ordered
-Ordered lists are lists in which the order of the items does matter.

3] Nesting lists
-It is perfectly ok to nest one list inside another one.
You might want to have some sub-bullets sitting below a top level bullet.

4] Emphasis and importance
a)Emphasis
-When we want to add emphasis in spoken language, we stress certain words, subtly altering the meaning of what we are saying.
 Similarly, in written language we tend to stress words by putting them in italics

 b)Strong
 -To emphasize important words, we tend to stress them in spoken language and bold them in written language.

5] Italic, bold, underline...
-<i> is used to convey a meaning traditionally conveyed by italic: Foreign words, taxonomic designation, technical terms, a thought...
-<b> is used to convey a meaning traditionally conveyed by bold: Key words, product names, lead sentence...
-<u> is used to convey a meaning traditionally conveyed by underline: Proper name, misspelling...
