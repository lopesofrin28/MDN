* The head of an HTML document is the part that is not displayed in the web browser when the page is loaded.
It contains information such as the page <title>, links to CSS (if you choose to style your HTML content with CSS),
links to custom favicons, and other metadata (data about the HTML, such as the author, and important keywords that
describe the document.)

* Adding a title:
-The <title> element is metadata that represents the title of the overall HTML document (not the document's content.)

*The <title> element contents are also used in other ways. For example, if you try bookmarking the page
(Bookmarks > Bookmark This Page or the star icon in the URL bar in Firefox), you will see the <title> contents filled
in as the suggested bookmark name.


* Metadata: the <meta> element
Metadata is data that describes data, and HTML has an "official" way of adding metadata to a document â€” the <meta> element.
Of course, the other stuff we are talking about in this article could also be thought of as metadata too.


* Adding an author and description:

Many <meta> elements include name and content attributes:
  -name specifies the type of meta element it is; what type of information it contains.
  -content specifies the actual meta content.

* Other types of metadata

-As you travel around the web, you'll find other types of metadata, too.
A lot of the features you'll see on websites are proprietary creations, designed to provide certain sites
(such as social networking sites) with specific pieces of information they can use.

-For example, Open Graph Data(og) is a metadata protocol that Facebook invented to provide richer metadata for websites.
-Twitter also has its own similar proprietary metadata called Twitter Cards, which has a similar effect when the site's
URL is displayed on twitter.com.


*Adding custom icons to your site:

-To further enrich your site design, you can add references to custom icons in your metadata,
and these will be displayed in certain contexts. The most commonly used of these is the favicon
(short for "favorites icon", referring to its use in the "favorites" or "bookmarks" lists in browsers).


* Applying CSS and JavaScript to HTML:
-Just about all websites you'll use in the modern day will employ CSS to make them look cool,
and JavaScript to power interactive functionality, such as video players, maps, games, and more.
These are most commonly applied to a web page using the <link> element and the <script> element, respectively.
