* What is HTML?
  HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language.
  It is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit.
  It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be.
  HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up
  different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way.
  The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on.


* Block versus inline elements:

-Block-level elements form a visible block on a page.
  A block-level element appears on a new line following the content that precedes it.
  Any content that follows a block-level element also appears on a new line.
  Block-level elements are usually structural elements on the page.
  For example, a block-level element might represent paragraphs, lists, navigation menus, or footers.
  A block-level element wouldn't be nested inside an inline element, but it might be nested inside another block-level element.

-Inline elements are contained within block-level elements, and surround only small parts of the documentâ€™s content.
 (not entire paragraphs or groupings of content) An inline element will not cause a new line to appear in the document.
  It is typically used with text. For example, as an <a> element (hyperlink) or emphasis elements such as <em> or <strong>.


* Empty elements:

-Not all elements follow the pattern of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag.
Some elements consist of a single tag, which is typically used to insert/embed something in the document.
For example, the <img> element embeds an image file onto a page.

* Attributes:

-Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content.
-An attribute should have:
    -A space between it and the element name. (For an element with more than one attribute, the attributes should be
    separated by spaces too.)
    -The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.
    -An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.


* Boolean attributes:
  -Sometimes you will see attributes written without values. This is entirely acceptable.
  These are called Boolean attributes. Boolean attributes can only have one value, which is generally the same as the attribute name.
  For example, consider the disabled attribute, which you can assign to form input elements.
  (You use this to disable the form input elements so the user can't make entries.
  The disabled elements typically have a grayed-out appearance.)
