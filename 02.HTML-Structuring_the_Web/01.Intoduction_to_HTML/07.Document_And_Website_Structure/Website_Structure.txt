*Basic sections of a document
-Webpages can and will look pretty different from one another, but they all tend to share similar standard components,
 unless the page is displaying a fullscreen video or game, is part of some kind of art project, or is just badly structured:

1]header: <header>
-Usually a big strip across the top with a big heading, logo, and perhaps a tagline.
This usually stays the same from one webpage to another.

2]navigation bar: <nav>
Links to the site's main sections; usually represented by menu buttons, links, or tabs.
Like the header, this content usually remains consistent from one webpage to another —
having inconsistent navigation on your website will just lead to confused, frustrated users.
Many web designers consider the navigation bar to be part of the header rather than an individual component,
but that's not a requirement; in fact, some also argue that having the two separate is better for accessibility,
as screen readers can read the two features better if they are separate.

3]main content: <main>
A big area in the center that contains most of the unique content of a given webpage,
for example, the video you want to watch, or the main story you're reading, or the map you want to view,
or the news headlines, etc. This is the one part of the website that definitely will vary from page to page!

Note: main content: <main>, with various content subsections represented by <article>, <section>, and <div> elements.
[A] article:
-The HTML <article> element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site,
which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication).
Examples include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry.

[B] Section:
-The HTML <section> element represents a standalone section — which doesn't have a more specific semantic element
to represent it — contained within an HTML document. Typically, but not always, sections have a heading.

[C] Div:
-The HTML Content Division element (<div>) is the generic container for flow content.
It has no effect on the content or layout until styled using CSS.


4]sidebar: <aside>
Some peripheral info, links, quotes, ads, etc. Usually, this is contextual to what is contained in the main content
 (for example on a news article page, the sidebar might contain the author's bio, or links to related articles)
 but there are also cases where you'll find some recurring elements like a secondary navigation system.

 [A] Aside:
 -The HTML <aside> element represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the
 document's main content. Asides are frequently presented as sidebars or call-out boxes.
 Example CSS: {
               float:right;
               }


5]footer:
A strip across the bottom of the page that generally contains fine print, copyright notices, or contact info.
It's a place to put common information (like the header) but usually, that information is not critical or
secondary to the website itself. The footer is also sometimes used for SEO purposes, by providing links
for quick access to popular content.
