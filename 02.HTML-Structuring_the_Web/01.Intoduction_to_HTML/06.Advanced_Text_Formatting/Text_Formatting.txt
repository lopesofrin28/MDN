*Description lists
-In HTML text fundamentals, we walked through how to mark up basic lists in HTML,
 but we didn't mention the third type of list you'll occasionally come across — description lists.
 The purpose of these lists is to mark up a set of items and their associated descriptions, such as terms and definitions,
  or questions and answers.

-Description lists use a different wrapper than the other list types — <dl>;
in addition each term is wrapped in a <dt> (description term) element, and each description is wrapped in
a <dd> (description definition) element.


*Quotations
- HTML also has features available for marking up quotations; which element you use depends on whether you are
marking up a block or inline quotation.

1]Blockquotes
2]Inline quotations


*Citations
-The content of the cite attribute sounds useful, but unfortunately browsers, screenreaders, etc.
don't really do much with it. There is no way to get the browser to display the contents of cite, without
writing your own solution using JavaScript or CSS.

*Abbreviations
-Another fairly common element you'll meet when looking around the Web is <abbr> —
this is used to wrap around an abbreviation or acronym, and provide a full expansion of the term (included inside a title attribute.)

*Superscript and subscript
-You will occasionally need to use superscript and subscript when marking up items like dates,
chemical formulae, and mathematical equations so they have the correct meaning.
The <sup> and <sub> elements handle this job.

*Representing computer code:
-There are a number of elements available for marking up computer code using HTML:

<code>: For marking up generic pieces of computer code.
<pre>: For retaining whitespace (generally code blocks) — if you use indentation or excess whitespace inside your text,
browsers will ignore it and you will not see it on your rendered page.
If you wrap the text in <pre></pre> tags however, your whitespace will be rendered identically
to how you see it in your text editor.
<var>: For specifically marking up variable names.
<kbd>: For marking up keyboard (and other types of) input entered into the computer.
<samp>: For marking up the output of a computer program.

*Marking up times and dates
-HTML also provides the <time> element for marking up times and dates in a machine-readable format.
