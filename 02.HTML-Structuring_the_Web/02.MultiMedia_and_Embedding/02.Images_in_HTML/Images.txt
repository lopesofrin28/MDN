*How do we put an image on a webpage?
-In order to put a simple image on a webpage, we use the <img> element. This is an empty element
 (meaning that it has no text content or closing tag) that requires a minimum of one attribute to be useful â€”
 src (sometimes spoken as its full title, source). The src attribute contains a path pointing to the image
 you want to embed in the page, which can be a relative or absolute URL, in the same way as href attribute values in <a> elements.

 *Alternative text
-The next attribute we'll look at is alt. Its value is supposed to be a textual description of the image,
for use in situations where the image cannot be seen/displayed or takes a long time to render because of a slow internet connection.

*Width and height
-You can use the width and height attributes to specify the width and height of your image.
You can find your image's width and height in a number of ways.

*Image titles
-As with links, you can also add title attributes to images, to provide further supporting information if needed.
This gives us a tooltip on mouse hover, just like link titles.

*Annotating images with figures and figure captions
-Speaking of captions, there are a number of ways that you could add a caption to go with your image.
A better solution, is to use the HTML5 <figure> and <figcaption> elements. These are created for exactly this purpose:
to provide a semantic container for figures, and to clearly link the figure to the caption.

*CSS background images
-You can also use CSS to embed images into webpages (and JavaScript, but that's another story entirely).
The CSS background-image property, and the other background-* properties, are used to control background image placement.

-So why bother with HTML images? As hinted to above, CSS background images are for decoration only.
If you just want to add something pretty to your page to enhance the visuals, this is fine.
Though, such images have no semantic meaning at all. They can't have any text equivalents,
are invisible to screen readers, and so on. This is where HTML images shine!
