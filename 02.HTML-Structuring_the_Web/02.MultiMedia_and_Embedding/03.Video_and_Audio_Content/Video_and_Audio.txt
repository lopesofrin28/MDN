*Video and audio on the web

1]The <video> element
-The <video> element allows you to embed a video very easily.

*Other <video> features
-The new features are:

*width and height
-You can control the video size either with these attributes or with CSS. In both cases, videos maintain their
native width-height ratio — known as the aspect ratio. If the aspect ratio is not maintained by the sizes you set,
the video will grow to fill the space horizontally, and the unfilled space will just be given a solid background color by default.

*autoplay
-Makes the audio or video start playing right away, while the rest of the page is loading.
You are advised not to use autoplaying video (or audio) on your sites, because users can find it really annoying.

*loop
-Makes the video (or audio) start playing again whenever it finishes. This can also be annoying, so only use if really necessary.

*muted
-Causes the media to play with the sound turned off by default.

*poster
-The URL of an image which will be displayed before the video is played.
It is intended to be used for a splash screen or advertising screen.

*preload
-Used for buffering large files; it can take one of three values:
  "none" does not buffer the file
  "auto" buffers the media file
  "metadata" buffers only the metadata for the file



2] The <audio> element
-The <audio> element works just like the <video> element, with a few small differences
-This takes up less space than a video player, as there is no visual component —
you just need to display controls to play the audio. Other differences from HTML video are as follows:

-The <audio> element doesn't support the width/height attributes — again, there is no visual component,
so there is nothing to assign a width or height to.
-It also doesn't support the poster attribute — again, no visual component.



*Displaying video text tracks
-Wouldn't it be nice to be able to provide these people with a transcript of the words being spoken in the audio/video?
Well, thanks to HTML video, you can. To do so we use the WebVTT file format and the <track> element

-subtitles
Translations of foreign material, for people who don't understand the words spoken in the audio.
-captions
Synchronized transcriptions of dialog or descriptions of significant sounds, to let people who can't hear the audio
 understand what is going on.
-timed descriptions
Text which should be spoken by the media player in order to describe important visuals to blind or otherwise visually impaired users.
