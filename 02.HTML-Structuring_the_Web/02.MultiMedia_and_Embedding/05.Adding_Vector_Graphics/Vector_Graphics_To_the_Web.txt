*What are vector graphics?
-On the web, you'll work with two types of image — raster images, and vector images:

Raster images :
-They are defined using a grid of pixels — a raster image file contains information showing exactly where each pixel
is to be placed, and exactly what color it should be. Popular web raster formats include Bitmap (.bmp), PNG (.png), JPEG (.jpg),
and GIF (.gif.)

Vector images:
-They are defined using algorithms — a vector image file contains shape and path definitions that the computer can use
to work out what the image should look like when rendered on the screen. The SVG format allows us to create powerful vector graphics
for use on the Web.



*What is SVG?
-SVG is an XML-based language for describing vector images. It's basically markup, like HTML, except that you've
got many different elements for defining the shapes you want to appear in your image, and the effects you want to
apply to those shapes. SVG is for marking up graphics, not content. At the simplest end of the spectrum,
you've got elements for creating simple shapes, like <circle> and <rect>. More advanced SVG features
include <feColorMatrix> (transform colors using a transformation matrix,) <animate> (animate parts of your vector graphic,)
and <mask> (apply a mask over the top of your image.)

-Yes, you can handcode simple SVG in a text editor, but for a complex image this quickly starts to get very difficult.
For creating SVG images, most people use a vector graphics editor like Inkscape[https://inkscape.org/] or Illustrator[https://www.adobe.com/in/products/illustrator.html].
 These packages allow you to create a variety of illustrations using various graphics tools, and create approximations of photos
 (for example Inkscape's Trace Bitmap feature.)

 *Adding SVG to your pages
-In this section we'll go through the different ways in which you can add SVG vector graphics to your web pages.

[1]The quick way: <img>
To embed an SVG via an <img> element, you just need to reference it in the src attribute as you'd expect.
You will need a height or a width attribute (or both if your SVG has no inherent aspect ratio).
If you have not already done so, please read Images in HTML.

*Troubleshooting and cross-browser support
-For browsers that don't support SVG (IE 8 and below, Android 2.3 and below), you could reference a PNG or JPG
from your src attribute and use a srcset attribute (which only recent browsers recognize) to reference the SVG.
 This being the case, only supporting browsers will load the SVG — older browsers will load the PNG instead:


*How to include SVG code inside your HTML
-You can also open up the SVG file in a text editor, copy the SVG code, and paste it into your HTML document —
this is sometimes called putting your SVG inline, or inlining SVG. Make sure your SVG code snippet begins and ends
 with the <svg></svg> tags (don't include anything outside those.)

 *How to embed an SVG with an <iframe>
-You can open SVG images in your browser just like webpages. So embedding an SVG document with an <iframe> is done
 just like we studied in From <object> to <iframe> — other embedding technologies.
