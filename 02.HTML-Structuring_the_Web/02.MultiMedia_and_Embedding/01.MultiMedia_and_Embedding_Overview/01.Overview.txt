*Multimedia and Embedding
-This module explores how to use HTML to include multimedia in your web pages, including the different ways
that images can be included, and how to embed video, audio, and even entire webpages.

This module contains the following articles which will take you through all the fundamentals of embedding multimedia on webpages.

1]Images in HTML
-There are other types of multimedia to consider, but it is logical to start with the humble <img> element used to embed
 a simple image in a webpage. In this article we'll look at how to use it in more depth, including basics, annotating it
 with captions using <figure>, and how it relates to CSS background images.

2]Video and audio content
Next, we'll look at how to use the HTML5 <video> and <audio> elements to embed video and audio on our pages,
including basics, providing access to different file formats to different browsers, adding captions and subtitles,
 and how to add fallbacks for older browsers.

3]From <object> to <iframe> — other embedding technologies
At this point we'd like to take somewhat of a sideways step, looking at a couple of elements that allow you
to embed a wide variety of content types into your webpages: the <iframe>, <embed> and <object> elements.
<iframe>s are for embedding other web pages, and the other two allow you to embed PDFs, SVG, and even Flash —
a technology on its way out, but which you may still see semi-regularly.

4]Adding vector graphics to the web
Vector graphics can be very useful in certain situations. Unlike regular formats like PNG/JPG,
they don't distort/pixelate when zoomed in — they can remain smooth when scaled. This article introduces you
to what vector graphics are and how to include the popular SVG format in web pages.

5]Responsive images
In this article, we'll learn about the concept of responsive images — images that work well on devices
 with widely differing screen sizes, resolutions, and other such features — and look at what tools HTML
 provides to help implement them. This helps to improve performance across different devices.
 Responsive images are just one part of responsive design, a future CSS topic for you to learn.
